# TODO:
#   Create an abstract base model for these three models:
#   1. Help - for allowing users to send questions to admins
#      asking for help.
#   2. Review - for allowing users to make reviews of products
#      to be placed on the main page and on corresponding
#      product pages (maybe after moderation).
#   3. Comment - it's to decide whether this one would be
#      needed at all.
